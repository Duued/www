oh... o adds a newline and enters edit mode<br>
idk why but s deletes a character<br>
vim is weird i like nano<br>
<h1>
	bloop
</h1>
ok never mind auto indent is nice<br>
and syntax highlighting too<br>
ew why arent the newlines working on the browser<br>
ok vim is kinda neat i figured out how to replace/substitute things and i just<br>
:s/\n/&lt;br&gt;^M/100<br>
and i typed ^M by doing ctrl v and then enter<br>
lol i forgot that &lt;br&gt; needs to be escaped... lemme do that rq<br>
ok cool<br>
note to self: when using git rm use --cache if you dont want to remove it<br>
